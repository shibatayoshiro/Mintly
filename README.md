## Idea  
Transform every purchase into an investment. A new economic model where each product gets a token and each buyer becomes a micro-investor in the product's success.

---

## 🔧 How It Works  
- You buy a product (e.g., soda, book, bread).  
- The purchase is linked to a product token: `BuyToken[PRODUCT_ID]`.  
- You receive the token as a form of "smart cashback".  
- The token can:
  - Increase in value (if the product becomes popular),
  - Generate passive income (based on sales volume),
  - Be used in the ecosystem (swap, farming, voting, etc.).

---

## 🎯 Goals  
- Turn spending into earning  
- Make consumption data transparent and valuable  
- Encourage conscious consumer behavior  
- Give users a stake in market trends

---

## 💡 What’s New  
- The buyer = market participant = micro-investor  
- Each product has its own token and micro-economy  
- Built on blockchain: transparent, decentralized, trustless  
- Viral mechanics: share what you believe in and benefit

---

## 🔥 Examples  
- Buy a new soda → it goes viral → your token gains 5x  
- Buy an unpopular product → you earn more tokens (to boost demand)  
- Support a new brand → grow with it simply by shopping
